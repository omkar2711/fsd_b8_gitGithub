Routing : Routing is a technique used in web development to navigate 
between different pages within a web application. 

React Router :
    - Enables MultiPage behavior in SPA.
    - Allows navigation without full page reloads.
    - Provides dynamic route matching for components.


React Router Dom : React Router DOM is a popular library for implementing routing in 
React applications. It provides a set of components and functions that allow developers 
to define routes, handle navigation, and manage the browser history.


step1 : install react-router-dom 
step2 : setup routing in App.jsx (Wrapping Routes in BrowserRouter)
step3 : Create different pages/components for different routes
step4 : Define Routes using Route component



Nested Routes : Nested routes allow you to define routes within other routes, 
enabling a hierarchical structure for your application's navigation. 

Outlet component : The Outlet component is used in React Router to render nested routes. 
It acts as a placeholder for child routes defined within a parent route.


Dynamic Routing  -> params -> useparams
useNavigate -> navigation programmatically to different routes.


Lazy Loading : Lazy loading is a technique used to optimize the performance of 
web applications by loading components or resources only when they are needed.
