State : State is data that changes over time and affects the UI.

Problem prop Drilling:
    passing props multiple levels
    hard to manage & debug

Global State Management

Redux:
    Centralized state 
    Predectable behaviour
    Easy to maintain and debug
    flexible, larger apps



Redux Core principle
    1. Single Source of Truth
    2. State is Read Only
    3. Changes are made through Pure Functions(Reducers)

Redux:
    Too much code / boilerPlates
    Too many files to maintain


Redux Toolkit


1. Store : Its a central place where the entire application's state is stored.  -> configureStore
2. Action : is an object describing what event had occourred, type
    Action Creator (function) : return an action object
3. Reducers : Pure Functions 
            Current/initial State 
            Action
            Returns -> Updated State / new State
4. Dipatch : Used to send action to the stored -> useDispatch();
5. Selectors : Are functions used to extract the state from the stored -> useSelector();

6. Slice : (State + action creators + reducers) -> createSlice
7. Thunk / createAsyncThunk : Async code / logic 
8. Provider : Connects store to react
